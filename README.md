# 🧬 QuantumLifeForm

**QuantumLifeForm** is a conceptual simulation that merges **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** with **Quantum Computing** to model a digital organism. It explores how a lifeform can perceive, decide, mutate, and survive using both deterministic logic and quantum randomness.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 AI-driven decision-making (explore, rest, recharge)
- ⚛️ Quantum mutation engine using Qiskit
- 💡 Dynamic traits based on 3-qubit quantum circuits
- 🔁 Simulated life cycle with energy-based survival
- 🧬 Simple memory and adaptive behavior loop

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### AI Layer
- Tracks internal **energy**, **traits**, and **environmental memory**
- Chooses actions based on trait logic and current energy

### Quantum Layer
- Uses a **3-qubit quantum circuit** (with Hadamard gates) to mutate the lifeform’s traits
- Qubit measurements (0s and 1s) are mapped to a 3-bit genome representing traits

### Life Cycle
1. **Perceive** the environment
2. **Mutate** traits via quantum randomness
3. **Decide** the next action
4. **Act** (recharge, rest, or explore)
5. **Check energy** — if energy ≤ 0, the lifeform dies
