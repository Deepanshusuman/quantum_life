# QuantumLifeForm

**QuantumLifeForm** is an experimental simulation that merges **Artificial Intelligence** with **Quantum Computing** to model a simple form of artificial life. This prototype demonstrates how quantum randomness and classical decision-making can coexist to simulate behavior, evolution, and survival in a minimalistic lifeform.

## ðŸŒ± Concept

Each QuantumLifeForm:
- Perceives its environment
- Makes decisions based on AI logic (energy, traits, memory)
- Mutates its traits using a quantum circuit (via Qiskit)
- Acts in a simulated loop and evolves over time

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Basic AI decision engine (recharge, explore, rest)
- âœ… Quantum-based genetic mutation (using Hadamard gates)
- âœ… Energy-based survival and death mechanism
- âœ… Simple memory of past environments

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `qiskit`
- `numpy`

```bash
pip install qiskit numpy
```
