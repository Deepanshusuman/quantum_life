# ðŸ§  How It Works
## AI Layer
Tracks energy, memory, and traits

Decides actions based on internal state and trait logic

## Quantum Layer
Uses a 3-qubit quantum circuit to mutate traits

Traits are measured and mapped from qubit outputs (0s and 1s)

## Life Cycle
Action affects energy (e.g., explore costs energy)

If energy â‰¤ 0, the lifeform dies

## ðŸ§¬ Future Ideas
Neural networkâ€“based behavior learning

Multi-agent ecosystem simulation

Reproduction and trait inheritance

Real-time visualization

Real quantum hardware integration (IBM Q backend)
